## Features

###  üë§ Create Agents
Create new agents, edit their configuration and organise them into folders.<br>
Multi-member workflows can be saved as a single agent ~~and nested infinitely (coming soon)~~.

### üìù Manage Chats
View, continue and delete previous workflow chats and organise them into folders.<br>

### üå± Branching Workflows
Messages, tools and code can be edited and re-run, allowing a more practical way to chat with your workflow.<br>
Branching works with all plugins and multi-member chats.<br>

### üë• Graph Workflows
Seamlessly add other members or blocks to a workflow and configure how they interact with each other.<br>
Workflow behaviour can be modified with a plugin.

### üî† Blocks
Manage a collection of nestable blocks available to use in any workflow, 
allowing reusability and consistency across multiple agents.<br>
You can use blocks in text by using the block name in curly braces, e.g. `{block-name}`.
- **Text** - A simple text block that can nest other blocks.
- **Code** - A code block that is executed and gets the output.
- **Prompt** - A prompt block that gets an LLM response.
- **Metaprompt** - Used by the system for AI enhancement.

### üî® Tools 
Create, edit and delete tools, configure their parameters, code, language and environment.<br>
Tools can be added to an Agent or used individually as a workflow component.<br>

### ü™Ñ AI Generation
Various aspects of Agent Pilot use AI to enhance the user experience, including:
- **Text input** - An AI generated prompt replaces the user's input.

### üîå Plugins
Agent Pilot supports the following plugins:
- **Agent** - Create custom agent behaviour.
- - [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter)
- - [OpenAI Assistant](/)
- - [CrewAI Agent](/) (Currently disabled)
- **Workflow** - Create workflow behaviour.
- - [CrewAI Workflow](/) (Currently disabled)
- **Provider** - Add support for a model provider.
- - [Litellm (100+ models)](/)

- [Create a plugin](/)

### üíª Code Interpreter
Open Interpreter is integrated into Agent Pilot, and can either be used standalone as a plugin 
or utilised by any Agent or context block to execute code.
<br>
Code auto-run can be enabled in the settings, but use this with caution, you should always
understand the code that is being run, any code you execute is your own responsibility.<br>
Try something like "Split this image into quarters" and see the power of Open Interpreter

### üëÑ Voice
Agents can be linked to a text-to-speech service, combine with a personality context block and make your agent come to life!<br>

## Contributions
Contributions to Agent Pilot are welcome and appreciated. Please feel free to submit a pull request.

## Known Issues
- Be careful using auto run code and open interpreter, any chat you open, if code is the last message it will start auto running, I'll add a flag to remember if the countdown has been stopped.
- Windows exe must have console visible due to a strange bug.
- Changing the config of an OpenAI Assistant won't reload the assistant, for now close and reopen the chat.
- Issue on linux, creating venv does not install pip
